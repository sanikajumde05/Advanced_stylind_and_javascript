üöÄ Advanced Styling and JavaScript
This project is a modern, responsive web page showcasing advanced CSS and JavaScript techniques. It is built using HTML5, Tailwind CSS v2.2.19, Font Awesome v6.5.2, and Vanilla JavaScript.
The page contains three main sections:

1. Responsive Design Demonstration:
* A section displays three different device categories: Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop.
* Custom media queries are used to change font sizes (custom-title) and image heights (carousel-img) according to screen size.
* The layout adapts automatically as the window is resized, providing a real-time visual demonstration of responsive design.

2. Interactive Image Carousel:
* A fully working JavaScript image carousel.
* Users can navigate through a collection of images from Unsplash using previous and next buttons.
* Captions update dynamically with each image.
* Keyboard arrow keys (‚Üê and ‚Üí) are supported for navigation.
* Smooth transitions are applied to image changes.

3. Fetching Data from an External API:
* A "Random Joke" section dynamically fetches jokes from the Official Joke API using fetch and async/await.
* Users can click the "New Joke" button to retrieve a fresh joke without reloading the page.
* Loading animations and error handling are implemented to improve the user experience.
